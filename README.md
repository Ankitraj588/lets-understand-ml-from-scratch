# 🎓 Placement Prediction using Linear Regression

This project predicts whether a student will get placed based on their **CGPA** and **IQ score** using a **Linear Regression** model.

## 📌 Features
- Input features: `cgpa`, `iq`
- Output: `placement` (0 = not placed, 1 = placed)
- Model: Scikit-learn's `LinearRegression`
- Serialization: Model saved using `pickle`
